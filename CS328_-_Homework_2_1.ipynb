    "# 2 Developing a raw photograph (85 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually any computer device in existence today is equipped with at least one digital camera; with over 5 billion users of digital photography, this technology has now fully permeated our society. In this exercise, you will get to build your own image processing pipeline that applies color space transformations to turn the raw data measured by a digital camera into a usable image that can be viewed on a computer screen. In the following, we will explain what this means, and how to implement the associated steps using tools from numerical linear algebra. But first, we shall begin with a brief review of the process that takes place when taking a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital camera uses an assembly of optical elements to focus the incident light onto a silicon sensor that consists of millions of tiny regions arranged in a regular grid.  The silicon is sensitive to light, and each small region on the sensor (generally referred to as a *pixel*) measures the portion of light that falls on it. \n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"//rgl.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/wjakob/2016/10/20/ccdcamera.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When no picture is being taken, the sensor is either inactive or used for a live preview (as in mobile phones or smaller cameras). When the actual photograph is taken, it is important to be able to control the precise amount of time during which  light is collected by the sensor. This is realized by means of the *shutter*, a small mechanical or electronic barrier that prevents light from reaching the sensor. The shutter can open and close very quickly, in about 1/4000th of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "When taking a picture, the camera perform a sequence of steps in rapid succession: first, the shutter opens, allowing light to reach the pixels on the sensor. For a brief duration (known as the *exposure time*), the sensor collects all light that reaches the surface.  To be able to distinguish colors, each pixel on the sensor is covered with a tiny filter that will only permit certain wavelengths of light to pass through.\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"//rgl.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/wjakob/2016/10/20/photon_rain.png\">\n",
    "Due its physical nature, light reaches the sensor in discrete amounts not unlike droplets of rain that fill a number of buckets with water. When the exposure time is very short, each pixel may only have received a few droplets, and the image is very noisy. When the exposure time is too long, the buckets will fill up completely, and it is impossible to recover a usable image. Once the exposure time has elapsed, the shutter closes so that the measurement ceases to change any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the measurement is frozen, the camera proceeds to performs a full readout of the data associated with each pixel (i.e. the \"fill height\" of each bucket in the illustration above). This data is known as a *raw image*: a representation of the original sensor data without any additional processing. Raw images play a similar role as negatives in traditional photography: they contain all of the information that is needed to eventually create an image, but they aren't yet usable as an image on their own. Converting a raw image into an actual image entails decoding the information on the sensor and translating this data into displayable red/green/blue intensities that \"make sense\" on a computer screen, and which reproduce the colors that a human would have observed in the moment when the photo was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to classical photography, the process of turning the raw sensor data into a usable image is referred to as \"developing\" the image. Cell phone cameras generally perform this step automatically without user intervention. On the other hand, most professional cameras allow the user to choose between developing the image automatically within the camera or storing undeveloped raw images that can be manually developed by the user later on. The latter has become extremely popular, since raw image contain more information than would be available in a fully processed image (such as a JPEG image). For instance, JPEG files may not be able to represent the full range of colors perceived by the camera's sensor, and the lossy compression implies that there is some loss of image quality. A range of commercial (Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, ..) and free (RawTherapee, darktable, ..) software tools can be used to develop raw image with full artistic control over the output.\n",

    "Very strange.. what is going on here? The pattern you see turns out to be related to the design of the sensor that was discussed earlier. Because it's impossible for a single pixel to distinguish among different colors, the sensor consists of a regular arrangement of pixels that are sensitive to red, green, and blue. This is known as a *Bayer grid*. Note that the sensor contains twice as many green pixels as red or blue pixels; the reason for this  physiology: the eyes of humans are more sensitive to green wavelengths of light, hence it makes sense to capture the associated color information at a higher resolution.\n",

Very high quality demosaicing algorithms exist that do a great job at filling in the missing information, but they can be quite complicated to implement. \n",

In other words, a color (such as ``[0.0, 0.5, 0.5]``,  which could be a dark blue green) captured by one device will need to be transformed so that it truly reproduces that same color on another device.\n",
